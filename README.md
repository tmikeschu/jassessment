# Word Watch ðŸ‘€

## Environment Setup

Clone and navigate to the directory in your preferred way, or

* Download the latest [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for a Mac-64 environment.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tmikeschu/jassessment.git
cd jassessment
```

then

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Make sure to keep `npm run build` running in a separate terminal session to
watch for changes in your code.

## Objectives

* All JavaScript functions are backed by unit tests.
* You do not need to (and should not attempt to) add any HTML or CSS. Focus on
  the JavaScript.

### 1

As a user  
when I visit Word Watch  
and paste a paragraph into the "Paste text here" textarea  
and I click "Break down"  
Then I should see text appear on the right side of the page  
With each word from the paragraph only shown once  
and the size of each word is relative the frequency in the paragraph.  

### 2

As a user  
I can do the same thing as #1  
except instead of clicking "Break down"  
I can simply hit the return/enter key.  

### 3

As a user,  
when I visit Word Watch  
I should see the top used word and its count (based on the Word Watch API database)  
in the "Top Word: " heading.  
e.g., "Top Word: cibatta (22)"  

### 4

For stories 1 and 2,
each word should be sent via POST request to the Word Watch API. See the
[repo](https://github.com/tmikeschu/wordwatch_api) for details.
