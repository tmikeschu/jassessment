## Environment Setup

Clone and navigate to the directory in your preferred way, or

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tmikeschu/jassessment.git
cd jassessment
```

then

```shell

Make sure to keep `npm run build` running in a separate terminal session to
watch for changes in your code.

## Objectives

* All JavaScript functions are backed by unit tests.
* You do not need to (and should not attempt to) add any HTML or CSS. Focus on
  the JavaScript.

### 1

As a user
when I visit Word Watch
and paste a paragraph into the "Paste text here" textarea
and I click "Break down"
Then I should see text appear on the right side of the page
With each word from the paragraph only shown once
and the size of each word is relative the frequency in the paragraph.

### 2

As a user
I can do the same thing as #1
except instead of clicking "Break down"
I can simply hit the return/enter key.

### 3

As a user who has gone through process #1 or #2
I can tab through every element on the page
And there should be visibly hidden information
that tells me "_ times" the word appears in the text.

### 4

As a user,
when I visit WordWatch
based on the Word Watch API database
I should see the top used word and its count in the "Top Word: " heading.
e.g., "Top Word: cibatta (22)"

### 5

For stories 1 and 2,
each word should be sent via POST request to the Word Watch API. See the
[repo](https://github.com/tmikeschu/wordwatch_api) for details.
