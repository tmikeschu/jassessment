# Word Watch ðŸ‘€

---

## Objectives

* All JavaScript functions are backed by unit tests

### 1

As a user
when I visit Word Watch
and paste a paragraph into the "Paste text here" textarea
and I click "Break down"
Then I should see text appear on the right side of the page
With each word from the paragraph only shown once
and the size of each word is relative the frequency in the paragraph.

### 2

As a user
I can do the same thing as #1
except instead of clicking "Break down"
I can simply hit the return/enter key.

### 3

As a user who has gone through process #1 or #2
I can tab through every element on the page
And there should be visibly hidden information
that tells me "_ times" the word appears in the text.
